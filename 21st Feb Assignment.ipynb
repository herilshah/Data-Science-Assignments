    "Definition of Web Scraping\n",
    "Web scraping is a technique of extracting data from websites using automated software or tools. The software extracts the data from the HTML pages of the website, and then the data is transformed into a structured format, such as a CSV or JSON file, which can be analyzed or used for other purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Web Scraping is Used\n",
    "Web scraping is used for various purposes, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "To gather data for research or analysis\n",
    "To monitor and track changes in website content\n",
    "To build datasets for machine learning or data analysis\n",
    "To automate repetitive tasks, such as data entry or data validation\n",
    "To extract data from websites that do not offer APIs or data feeds\n",
    "Three Areas Where Web Scraping is Used to Get Data\n",
    "Web scraping is used in various areas to gather data, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce: To gather product information, pricing, and reviews from online stores.\n",
    "Social media: To collect user data and analyze sentiment.\n",
    "Finance: To gather stock prices, news articles, and financial statements."

    "There are different methods used for web scraping, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Manual copying and pasting: This is the most basic form of web scraping, where data is copied and pasted from websites into a spreadsheet or database. This method is time-consuming and inefficient for large-scale data extraction, but it can be useful for small projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)HTML parsing: HTML parsing involves using programming languages such as Python or Ruby to extract data from HTML code. This method requires some programming knowledge but is more efficient than manual copying and pasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Web scraping software: Web scraping software such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium can automate the process of data extraction. These tools use scripts or code to navigate websites, extract data, and save it in a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)API scraping: Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access their data programmatically. API scraping involves using code to interact with these APIs and extract data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Headless browsing: Headless browsing involves using web browsers such as Chrome or Firefox in a non-graphical mode to automate web scraping. This method can be useful for extracting data from websites that use JavaScript or require login credentials."

For example, you could use Flask to build a simple web application that allows users to enter a URL and extract all the hyperlinks from the page. Flask can also be used to create APIs that allow developers to access the data that has been scraped, making it easier to integrate the data into other applications or services."

    "The project uses two main AWS services: AWS CodePipeline and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Here is an explanation of the use of each service in the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)AWS CodePipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps automate the release process of software. It allows users to create a pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys code every time there is a code change, ensuring fast and reliable application delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, AWS CodePipeline is used fetch data from github respository and to set up a continuous delivery workflow that automatically builds, tests, and deploys code changes to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It is used to manage the deployment of the code to Elastic Beanstalk, ensuring that the application is built, tested, and deployed in a consistent and reliable manner. The pipeline can be configured to automatically deploy the application to Elastic Beanstalk after successful testing, reducing manual effort and increasing deployment frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)AWS Elastic Beanstalk:\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud. It provides a scalable and reliable environment for running web applications, handling the underlying infrastructure, and scaling resources as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, AWS Elastic Beanstalk is used to host the web application. It provides a scalable and reliable environment for running the application, handling the underlying infrastructure, and scaling resources as needed. It also provides automatic deployment, monitoring, and scaling features, making it easy to deploy and manage the application. It can be easily integrated with AWS CodePipeline to create a seamless continuous delivery workflow, ensuring fast and reliable application delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the use of AWS CodePipeline and AWS Elastic Beanstalk together provides a powerful platform for deploying and managing web applications in the AWS Cloud. It allows developers to automate the release process, reduce the time between code changes and deployment, while also providing a reliable and scalable environment for hosting the application.\n",
