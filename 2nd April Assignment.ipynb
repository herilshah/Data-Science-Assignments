    "Grid search CV (Cross-Validation) is a hyperparameter tuning technique used in machine learning to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a given model. It works by creating a grid of all possible hyperparameter combinations and evaluates the model performance using cross-validation on each combination. The hyperparameter combination that yields the best cross-validation score is selected as the optimal set of hyperparameters.\n"

    "The main difference between grid search CV and random search CV is that grid search CV evaluates all possible combinations of hyperparameters, while random search CV evaluates a random subset of the hyperparameter space. Random search CV may be more efficient when the hyperparameter space is large and the number of hyperparameters to tune is small. Grid search CV may be more suitable when the hyperparameter space is small, and the number of hyperparameters to tune is also small.\n"

    "Data leakage refers to a situation where information from outside the training data is inadvertently used to make predictions during model training or testing. Data leakage can lead to over-optimistic performance estimates and result in poor generalization performance on new data. An example of data leakage is when the feature selection process is performed on the entire dataset before splitting it into training and testing sets. This can lead to selecting features that are highly correlated with the target variable in the training set, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization performance on new data.\n",

This can be achieved by splitting the data into training and testing sets before performing any data preprocessing or feature selection. Another approach is to use nested cross-validation, where the hyperparameter tuning is performed on the inner loop of cross-validation, and the model performance is evaluated on the outer loop of cross-validation. This ensures that the hyperparameters are selected based on the training data only and evaluated on new unseen data."

Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN). Precision and recall have already been defined in Q6. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a balanced measure of the model's performance. It is calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall). ROC AUC is the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at different classification thresholds. ROC AUC measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative instances, regardless of the chosen classification threshold."

    "A confusion matrix can be used to identify potential biases or limitations in a machine learning model by examining the distribution of the predicted and actual classes. If the model is biased towards predicting one class more than the other, this can be detected by looking at the false positive and false negative rates. For example, if the model is predicting positive instances more frequently than negative instances, the false positive rate will be higher than the false negative rate. Similarly, if the model is biased towards negative predictions, the false negative rate will be higher than the false positive rate. By examining the distribution of the predicted and actual classes, it is possible to identify potential biases or limitations in the model and take steps to address them, such as adjusting the classification threshold or balancing the dataset."
