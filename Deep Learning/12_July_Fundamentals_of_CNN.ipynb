        "**Reasoning:**\n",
        "   - **Pixel Arrangement:** Images are composed of pixels, and the arrangement of these pixels does not follow a predetermined structure like a table with rows and columns.\n",
        "   - **Variable Dimensions:** Images can have varying dimensions (width and height), and the number of channels (e.g., RGB) adds another dimension, making them inherently flexible in terms of size and complexity.\n",
        "   - **Feature Representation:** Each pixel in an image represents a feature, and the relationships between these features are not explicitly defined as in structured data.\n",
