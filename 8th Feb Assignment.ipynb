    "Abstraction in OOPs is a technique of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential information required to perform a specific task. The idea behind abstraction is to simplify the complexity of a system by breaking it down into smaller parts, each of which has a well-defined interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a car, it has many internal parts such as an engine, transmission, wheels, etc. but as a user, you only need to know about the steering wheel, pedals, gear lever, etc. to drive it. Here, the internal implementation details of the car are abstracted away, and the user only interacts with the essential parts to operate the car."

    "Example: Consider a bank account, the user interacts with the bank account by making deposits and withdrawals through an ATM. The ATM provides a simple interface to access the bank account, but the internal details of how the bank account is implemented are hidden (abstraction). The bank account also protects the user's money by encapsulating it, i.e., wrapping the money within the account object and allowing access to it only through specific methods such as deposit and withdrawal."
