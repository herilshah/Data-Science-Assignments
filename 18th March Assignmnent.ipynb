    "The filter method is a feature selection method that selects a subset of features based on their statistical properties, such as correlation with the target variable or variance. It works by ranking the features based on a statistical metric, such as mutual information, chi-squared test, or correlation coefficient, and selecting the top-ranked features based on a predefined threshold or a fixed number of features."

    "The Wrapper method differs from the Filter method in that it evaluates subsets of features based on their ability to improve the performance of a given model, instead of selecting features based on their statistical properties. It works by iteratively training and evaluating the model on different subsets of features, and selecting the subset that results in the best performance. This method is more computationally expensive than the Filter method, but it can potentially lead to better performance by considering the interactions between features."

    "Some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods include regularization, decision trees, and neural networks. Regularization methods, such as Lasso and Ridge regression, penalize the model for using irrelevant or redundant features, and can effectively perform feature selection during the model training process. Decision trees and random forests can select features based on their importance score, which is calculated based on the frequency of the feature used in the decision tree or forest. Neural networks can use dropout or weight decay regularization to perform feature selection."
