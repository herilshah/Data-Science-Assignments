Hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters based on proximity. DBSCAN focuses on density and identifies clusters as regions with high density separated by areas of low density. GMM assumes clusters follow a Gaussian distribution. Spectral clustering leverages graph theory to find clusters based on graph connectivity."
