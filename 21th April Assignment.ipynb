    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN is how they calculate the distance between two data points:\n",

    "a) Euclidean distance: It measures the straight-line distance between two points in a multidimensional space. It calculates the square root of the sum of the squared differences between corresponding coordinates of the two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Manhattan distance: It measures the distance between two points by summing the absolute differences between their coordinates along each dimension. It calculates the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding coordinates of the two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This difference in distance calculation can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor. The impact can be observed in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean distance is sensitive to the magnitude and scale of features. It assumes that all features contribute equally to the distance calculation. If there are features with significantly different scales, they may dominate the distance calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan distance is more robust to differences in feature scales. It considers the absolute differences along each dimension, making it suitable for cases where the features have different units or scales."
