    "The main difference between linear regression and logistic regression models is the type of response variable they are used for. Linear regression is used when the response variable is continuous, while logistic regression is used when the response variable is categorical (binary or multi-class). In other words, linear regression predicts a numerical value, while logistic regression predicts the probability of an event occurring.\n",
