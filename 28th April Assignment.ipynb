    "Hierarchical clustering is a clustering technique that creates a tree-like structure of clusters, also known as a dendrogram. It differs from other clustering techniques in that it does not require the number of clusters to be predefined. Instead, hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters by iteratively merging or splitting clusters based on their similarity."
