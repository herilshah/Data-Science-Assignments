    "In a repeated measures ANOVA, missing data can be handled using various methods such as pairwise deletion, listwise deletion, imputation, and maximum likelihood estimation. Pairwise deletion retains data for each individual variable and omits data from any cases with missing data. Listwise deletion omits entire cases that contain missing data, which can result in a loss of statistical power and introduce bias if the data are not missing at random. Imputation involves estimating the missing values using statistical techniques such as mean imputation, regression imputation, or multiple imputation. Maximum likelihood estimation involves estimating the model parameters while accounting for the missing data using the observed data and an assumption about the distribution of the missing data.\n",

The Scheffe test is a more conservative test that controls for familywise error rate (FWER) and can be used when the number of pairwise comparisons is large. The Bonferroni test is another conservative test that controls for the FWER by adjusting the significance level for each comparison.
