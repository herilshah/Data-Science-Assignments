    "Boosting is a machine learning ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners (usually decision trees) to create a strong predictive model. It is a sequential process where each weak learner is trained to focus on the instances that were previously misclassified by the previous learners. Boosting algorithms aim to improve the overall performance of the model by iteratively adjusting the weights or probabilities assigned to each instance."
