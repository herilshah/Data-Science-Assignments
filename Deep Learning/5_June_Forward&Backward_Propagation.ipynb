        "Forward propagation in a neural network is the process of transmitting input data through the network's layers to produce an output. The primary purpose is to make predictions or generate an output based on the given input. During forward propagation, each layer performs a weighted sum of its inputs, adds biases, and applies an activation function to produce an output that serves as the input for the next layer. This process is repeated through all layers until the final output is obtained. Essentially, forward propagation allows the network to make predictions by transforming input data through its weights, biases, and activation functions."
