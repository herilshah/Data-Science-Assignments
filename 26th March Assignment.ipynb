    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function of a machine learning model. The cost function is a measure of the error or difference between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable in the model. The goal of gradient descent is to find the set of parameters that minimize the cost function and make the model predictions as accurate as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient descent algorithm works by iteratively adjusting the parameters of the model in the direction of steepest descent of the cost function. Specifically, it calculates the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter, and then updates the parameters by subtracting a fraction of the gradient from the current value. This fraction is called the learning rate and determines the step size of the parameter update.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process continues until the algorithm converges to a minimum of the cost function, where the gradient is zero or very close to zero. At this point, the parameters have been optimized to produce the best possible predictions on the training data.\n",

    "Gradient descent is widely used in machine learning to train various models, including linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. It is a powerful and efficient optimization algorithm that can handle large datasets and complex models. However, it requires careful tuning of the learning rate and can get stuck in local minima of the cost function if the initial parameters are not chosen carefully.\n"

However, it is important to be cautious when using polynomial regression to avoid overfitting the data.
